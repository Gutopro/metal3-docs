# Automatic secure boot

The automatic secure boot feature allows enabling and disabling UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) secure boot when provisioning a host. This feature requires supported hardware and compatible OS image. The current hardwares that support enabling UEFI secure boot are `iLO`, `iRMC` and `Redfish` drivers.

## Why do we need it

We need the Automatic secure boot when provisioning a host with high security requirements. Based on checksum and signature, the secure boot protects the host from loading malicious code in the boot process before loading the provisioned operating system.

## How to use it

To enable Automatic secure boot, first check if hardware is supported and then specify the value `UEFISecureBoot` for `bootMode` in the BareMetalHost custom resource. Please note, it is enabled before booting into the deployed instance and disabled when the ramdisk is running and on tear down. Below you can check the example:

```YAML
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: node-1
spec:
  online: true
  bootMACAddress: 00:5c:52:31:3a:9c
  bootMode: UEFISecureBoot
  ...
```

This will enable UEFI before booting the instance and disable it when deprovisioned. Note that the default value for `bootMode` is `UEFI`.
